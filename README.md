# kSC.py

The kSC.py script can determine the rate constant (and other parameters) including tunneling effect of any reaction. It incorporates several types of potential barriers, from squared to Eckart potentials. 

The user manual can be found in [`documentation/user_manual.pdf`](documentation/user_manual.pdf)

The theoretical background of the formulae can be found in [`documentation/theoretical_background.pdf`](documentation/theoretical_background.pdf)
